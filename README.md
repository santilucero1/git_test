Hello Odin!

this will be a little explanation about few Git commands.

Have to clone the remote repository:

    git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git

Then, when you make a change in the code, have to add the changes to a waiting state, after you can describe the changes maded using a commit.

    git add .
    git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"

Finally use push to upload the new code to github.

    git push

Can check the status of the workflow with status and log to see the logs.

    git status
    git log
